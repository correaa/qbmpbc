 This is the Qbox package.

 Qbox is a C++/MPI First-Principles Molecular Dynamics program.
 It implements electronic structure calculations within the framework
 of Density Functional Theory, using a plane-wave basis set and
 norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

 Qbox was developed by Francois Gygi <fgygi@ucdavis.edu>
