1. Environmental variable

   set KSSOLVPATH to the directory that contains this README file.

   In unix/linux, do 
      setenv KSSOLVPATH <directory name> 
   or
      export KSSOLVPATH=<directory name>

      You may want to add this to your .cshrc or .bashrc

   In Windows XP, 
      click on Start->My Computer 
      click View system information on the left (System Task) panel
      click Advanced
      click Environmental variables
      click new, type in the variable name KSSOLVPATH, and the directory 
      in which kssolv is installed.

2. Test problems 
   There are several test problems in this directory

   sih4_setup.m       --- silane molecule 
   sibulk_setup.m     --- Silicon bulk (2 Silicon atoms per cell)
   qdot_setup.m       --- A four electron quantum dot with an external potential
   ptnio_setup.m      --- PtNiO molecule
   co2_setup.m        --- carbon dioxide molecule
   h2o_setup.m        --- water molecule
   hnco_setup.m       --- isocyanic acid molecule
   c2h6_setup.m       --- ethane molecule

   After executing any one of these scripts, type 'mol' at the prompt. It'll
   show some of characteristics of the system

   Use 

     [Etotvec, X, vtot, rho] = scf(mol);

   or
  
     [Etotvec, X, vtot, rho] = dcm(mol);

   or
     [Etotvec, X, vtot, rho] = trdcm(mol);

   to compute the ground state energy (Etot) and wavefunctions (X)


   Do 'help dcm' or 'help scf' to see additional options allowed
   in these functions.
